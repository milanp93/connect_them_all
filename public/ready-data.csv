645f44eb-164c-3bf8-b6f0-0c01d46b1904;98.5;The school is very close to the tower, within a distance of 0.293 km, which greatly reduces implementation costs and technical hindrances. The high-density population at 134.63 people per km² ensures a higher return on investment as more people will benefit from the connectivity. GSM is already the existing infrastructure available, which further decreases the cost due to minimal setup requirements.;$5,000;Fiber connectivity could provide higher speed, but it involves significant installation costs due to the short distance but complex logistics around laying fiber cables.;$15,000;Peta osnovna škola;44.87577819824219;18.80883217
fb808d20-9522-3391-b3e9-aa1e14d30bbd;97.5;Located just 0.967 km from the tower with a very high population density of 80.77 people per km², which suggests a strong demand and provides a significant return on investment. Existing GSM infrastructure means low additional setup costs.;$5,500;Satellite connectivity offers geographical flexibility but would not be as cost-effective due to high ongoing costs and potentially lower speeds.;$20,000;JU Prva osnovna škola Brčko - Ilićka;44.8626709;18.816884994506836
54822c1e-a3d1-32e7-b612-cb1073a7af64;97;The school is within a feasible distance of 0.542 km from the tower, along with high population density at 87.71 people per km², which predicts a good ROI. The existing GSM network offers a reliable, cost-effective solution for coverage expansion.;$4,800;Wireless solutions like LTE provide higher speeds but require new infrastructure, resulting in higher initial costs without significantly improving impact.;$12,500;Ju Druga osnovna škola Brčko distrikt BiH;44.868011474609375;18.809297561645508
4a031c9a-535e-34b9-bc60-422c2bba5802;96.8;Being very close to the tower at just 0.68 km and having a high density of 88.72 people per square km suggests high service utilization. GSM technology, already in place, ensures cost-effective service continuity.;$6,000;Implementing Fiber will be unnecessarily costly and cumbersome given the tower’s existing proximity and GSM compatibility.;$18,000;JU Ekonomska škola Brčko distrikt BiH;44.86961364746094;18.806169509887695
f1d8e332-acb4-33b8-ada8-09eb6d54c5ee;96.5;The distance to the tower is merely 0.334 km and population density is high at 67.5 people per km², setting the stage for high ROI. GSM is an affordable option due to existing infrastructure, ensuring low implementation costs.;$5,200;LTE technology may offer a broader service range but comes with higher installation and operational costs without proportionate benefits at this proximity.;$14,000;JU Treća osnovna škola Brčko PŠ Grbavica;44.872657775878906;18.81062889099121
