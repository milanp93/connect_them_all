f54822c1e-a3d1-32e7-b612-cb1073a7af64;95;The GSM network type, proximity to the tower, and high population density make wireless the optimal solution. Wireless networks are typically less expensive to implement and maintain over short distances, and the population density here ensures that the cost per user is minimized, maximizing the score of impact.;10,000 USD;Fiber could provide higher data speeds, but it comes with a significantly higher installation cost and is less flexible than wireless. This makes it less favorable despite being a reliable long-term solution.;25,000 USD
545f44eb-ccac-3bf8-b6f0-0c01d46b1904;92;GSM with high population density over a small distance offers a very cost-effective connection using wireless technology. Maintaining the infrastructure is much less demanding compared to alternatives such as installing new fiber lines.;12,000 USD;Satellite can offer broad coverage but is much more expensive in terms of monthly costs, especially in dense areas where the cost per MB is notably high.;20,000 USD
2eebd8fe-0e6e-351f-9e53-5b5b5381478b;91;Proximity to the tower with a high population density makes GSM the best wireless solution for its affordability and ease of deployment, ensuring high efficiency in this scenario.;11,000 USD;Fiber optics, while reliable and fast, would mean high initial costs for installation and longer deployment times, reducing its practicality in this scenario.;30,000 USD
245f55eb-72dd-3c6f-8a7c-db0c75cb51b5;90;A GSM network is cost-effective over shorter distances with high population densities, giving a very high score due to low-cost implementation and maintenance that fits the density criteria optimally.;10,000 USD;Using a satellite would significantly increase monthly costs due to data usage, making it less viable. Setup costs are also higher compared to wireless, especially with advancements in GSM towers.;22,000 USD
60aa3d77-388c-3dee-bf5f-6b7dde193f7c;88;GSM is highly feasible due to the proximity to the existing infrastructure and a high density of users leading to lower per capita costs in setup and maintenance.;13,000 USD;Satellite might offer broader coverage, but with considerably higher costs in terms of both initial setup and ongoing fees due to the larger bandwidth requirements.;35,000 USD
